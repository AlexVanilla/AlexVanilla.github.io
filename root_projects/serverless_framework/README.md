TLDR:
* Serverless Framework is a **Function as a Service (FaaS)** where you can host a website
* Very similar to **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** but the main difference is scalability
* Works with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Quick start guide I used

https://serverless.com/learn/quick-start/

**Note to self:**
Use `sls deploy` to start the server up
Use `sls remove` to turn off server (to not incur charges in AWS)

**TODO:**
* Make own site using serverless
